The UrbanScope is a web-based interactive visualization tool that empowers users to explore their surrounding neighborhood with rich contextual data. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and public APIs (OpenWeatherMap, AQICN, Overpass), it allows users to:

->View a dynamic map of any location by clicking on it.

->Visualize real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

->Access live air quality information (AQI) with categorized health indicators.

->Identify nearby amenities like hospitals, restaurants, schools, banks, and pharmacies within a user-specified radius.

->View amenity counts and the nearest location for each type with custom icons on the map.

->Toggle between light and dark themes for better visual comfort.

This tool is especially useful for urban explorers, local decision-makers, and travelers looking to quickly assess the quality, accessibility, and livability of any area.
